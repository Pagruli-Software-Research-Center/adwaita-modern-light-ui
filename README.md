# Adwaita Modern Light UI Theme for Atom

This is an Atom UI theme inspired by Adwaita (Default GTK theme for Gnome Desktop).

There are many atom ui themes made by members of atom community to replica the adwaita theme but none matches the UI of the Gnome 3.8 +. So, I tried to make a theme that dissolves with the adwaita GTK theme under Gnome 3.8 and Gnome 40.

Happy theming! ðŸš€
